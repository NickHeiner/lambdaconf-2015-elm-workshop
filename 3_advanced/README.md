Elm Wizardry: Part 3
====================

If you've made it this far, at least one of three things is true:

1. You're an Elm-Fu Master!
2. You're curious what this game looks like when it's more fully fleshed out.
3. You're looking for a reference for how to implement something in Part 1 or Part 2.

All of these are perfectly fine reasons to be here. Welcome!

If you've already completed [Part 1](https://github.com/rtfeldman/lambdaconf-2015-elm-workshop/tree/master/1_basic) and [Part 2](https://github.com/rtfeldman/lambdaconf-2015-elm-workshop/tree/master/2_intermediate), you can feel free to play around in here and extend the game further.

Some ideas:

1. What if different monsters were stronger or weaker to different spells? For example, what if the Freeze spell did more damage against the Fire Elemental but less against the Water Elemental?
2. What if the monsters attacked back every time you cast a spell, not just when you use Recharge?
3. What if you additionally had a Heal spell, which increased your health (at the expense of mana) but which did not require selecting a monster like the other spells do?
