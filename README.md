An Adventure in Elm
===================

_LambdaConf 2015 Workshop: Writing an Adventure Game in Elm_

### Installing Elm

The Elm Platform (currently version 0.15) includes everything you'll need for the workshop.

---

* **OS X** users: [download the OS X Elm Installer](http://install.elm-lang.org/Elm-Platform-0.15.pkg)
* **Windows** users: [download the Windows Elm Installer](http://install.elm-lang.org/Elm-Platform-0.15.exe)
* **Other operating system** users: you will unfortunately need to [build from source](http://elm-lang.org/Install.elm#build-from-source). Sorry!

---

Once installation completes, you should be able to run the following:

* `elm-make --version` (This is the Elm compiler. It should be on version 0.1.2)
* `elm-package --version` (This is the Elm package manager. It should be on version 0.5)
* `elm-repl --version` (This is the Elm REPL. It should be on version 0.4)
* `elm-reactor --version` (This is the Elm Reactor, aka Time Traveling Debugger. It should be on version 0.3.1)

### More Materials Coming Soon!

By 11am Sunday there will be plenty more here. :)
