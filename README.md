An Adventure in Elm
===================

_LambdaConf 2015 Workshop: Writing an Adventure Game in Elm_

### Installing Elm

The Elm Platform (currently version 0.15) includes everything you'll need for the workshop.

---

If you are on **OS X** or **Windows**, you have two options for getting the Elm Platform:

*  If you happen to have [npm](http://npmjs.org) installed, you can get everything you need with `npm install -g elm`
* Alternatively, you can [download the OS X Elm Installer](http://install.elm-lang.org/Elm-Platform-0.15.pkg) or [download the Windows Elm Installer](http://install.elm-lang.org/Elm-Platform-0.15.exe).

If you are on **another operating system**, you will unfortunately need to [build from source](http://elm-lang.org/Install.elm#build-from-source). Sorry!

---

Once installation completes, you should be able to run the following:

* `elm-make --version` (This is the Elm compiler. It should be on version 0.1.2)
* `elm-package --version` (This is the Elm package manager. It should be on version 0.5)
* `elm-repl --version` (This is the Elm REPL. It should be on version 0.4)
* `elm-reactor --version` (This is the Elm Reactor, aka Time Traveling Debugger. It should be on version 0.3.1)

### More Materials Coming Soon!
